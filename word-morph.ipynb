So how would *word morphing* look like? If we want to do a seamless transition from one word into another, through which words would it pass?\n","\n","In this post I'll describe how I employed word2vec's embeddings and $A^*$ search algorithm to morph between words.\n","\n","In order to perform word morphing, we'll define a graph $G$ where the set of nodes $N$ represent words, and there's some weight function $f : N \\times N \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}$. Given a start word $n_{\\text{start}}$ and an end word $n_{\\text{end}}$, our goal is to find a path within the graph which minimizes the sum of weights induced by $f$:\n","\n","$\\text{argmin}_{\\langle n_1, ..., n_k \\rangle : k \\in \\mathbb{N}, n_1, ..., n_k \\in N, n_1 = n_{\\text{start}}, n_k = n_{\\text{end}}}\\sum_{i=1}^{k-1} f(n_i, n_{i+1})$\n","\n","Usually when people talk about word morphing they mean searching for a path between $n_{\\text{start}}$ and $n_{\\text{end}}$ where there's an edge only between words such that one can be achieved from the other by changing one letter, as can be seen [here](http://wordmorph.sarangconsulting.com/faq.php#1.2). In this case, $f(n_1, n_2)$ is 1 when such a change exists, and $\\infty$ otherwise.\n","\n","In this post I'll show you how to morph between semantically similar words, i.e. $f$ will be related to semantics. Here's an example to illustrate the difference between the two approaches: given $n_{\\text{start}} = \\text{tooth}$, $n_{\\text{end}} = \\text{light}$, the approach of changing one character at a time [can result](http://wordmorph.sarangconsulting.com/?source=tooth&target=light&submit=MORPH+WORDS) in\n","\n","```tooth, booth, boots, botts, bitts, bitos, bigos, bigot, bight, light```\n","\n","while the semantics approach which will be defined in this post results in\n","\n","```tooth, retina, X_ray, light```"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"uRXYaCsNle44","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# Word Semantics\n","In order to capture word semantics we'll use pretrained word2vec embeddings. To those of you who are not familiar with the algorithm, here's an excerpt from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec):\n","> Word2vec takes as its input a large corpus of text and produces a vector space, typically of several hundred dimensions, with each unique word in the corpus being assigned a corresponding vector in the space. Word vectors are positioned in the vector space such that words that share common contexts in the corpus are located in close proximity to one another in the space.\n","\n","It means every node in the graph can be associated with some vector in high dimensionality space (300 in our case). Therefore, we can naturally define a distance function between every two nodes. We'll use cosine similarity, since this is the metric usually used when one wants to semantically compare between word embeddings. From now on, I'll overload a node symbol $n$ to be its associated word's embedding vector.\n","\n","To use the word2vec embeddings, we'll download Google's pretrained embeddings, and use `gensim` package to access them."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"gOZ_m49slnUV","colab_type":"code","outputId":"b6cd6b49-d3a3-47b7-d974-9a93605b0474","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1564613261970,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":5409,"user":{"displayName":"Eyal Gruss","photoUrl":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-u09YaZrQAqY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAC64/Edn8Phw0CRs/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"10806915125759667398"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":94}},"source":["pip install astar"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Collecting astar\n","  Downloading https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/f4/89/e0c5ca926cd336b5e3e884329a815835bbfb72e6418f9d8ca0effdcceee1/astar-0.9-py2-none-any.whl\n","Installing collected packages: astar\n","Successfully installed astar-0.9\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Fp0eMe5ale48","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["import os\n","import gzip\n","import shutil\n","import requests\n","import gensim\n","import astar\n","import numpy as np"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"c3TipXmlle5J","colab_type":"code","outputId":"545ad4be-d59e-4632-8323-c54d81ab8155","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1564613304352,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":47750,"user":{"displayName":"Eyal Gruss","photoUrl":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-u09YaZrQAqY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAC64/Edn8Phw0CRs/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"10806915125759667398"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":76}},"source":["def download_file_from_google_drive(file_id, destination):\n","    drive_url = 'https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download'\n","\n","    session = requests.Session()\n","    response = session.get(drive_url, params={'id': file_id}, stream=True)\n","    token = get_confirm_token(response)\n","    \n","    if token:\n","        params = {'id': file_id, 'confirm': token}\n","        response = session.get(drive_url, params=params, stream=True)\n","    \n","    save_response_content(response, destination)    \n","\n","    \n","def get_confirm_token(response):\n","    for key, value in response.cookies.items():\n","        if key.startswith('download_warning'):\n","            return value\n","\n","        \n","def save_response_content(response, dest):\n","    CHUNK_SIZE = 32768\n","\n","    with open(dest, 'wb') as f:\n","        for chunk in response.iter_content(CHUNK_SIZE):\n","            if chunk:  # filter out keep-alive new chunks\n","                f.write(chunk)\n","    \n","    \n","def download_word2vec_if_needed(dest):\n","    if os.path.exists(dest):\n","        return\n","    word2vec_file_id = '0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM'\n","    zip_path = 'word2vec.bin.gz'\n","    download_file_from_google_drive(word2vec_file_id, zip_path)\n","    with gzip.open(zip_path, 'rb') as f_zip:\n","        with open(dest, 'wb') as f_dest:\n","            shutil.copyfileobj(f_zip, f_dest)\n","    os.remove(zip_path)\n","        \n","\n","word2vec_filename = 'word2vec.bin'\n","download_word2vec_if_needed(word2vec_filename)\n","\n","model = gensim.models.KeyedVectors.load_word2vec_format(word2vec_filename, binary=True, limit=100000)"],"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/smart_open/smart_open_lib.py:398: UserWarning: This function is deprecated, use smart_open.open instead.
